## üí∞ Index Mechanics

### Base Value System

- **Starting Value**: $100 (fixed baseline for performance tracking)
- **Formula**: `Current Index Value = (Current Market Cap / Base Market Cap) √ó 100`
- **Example**: If total market cap grows 25%, index value becomes $125 (+25%)

### Tier Classification

| Tier   | Market Cap | 90-Day Volume |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| Tier 1 | $50M+      | $5M+          |
| Tier 2 | $250M+     | $25M+         |
| Tier 3 | $500M+     | $50M+         |
| Tier 4 | $2B+       | $200M+        |

**80% Rule**: Index automatically shifts to higher tiers when ‚â•80% of tokens qualify

### Fee Structure

| Operation       | Fee            | When Applied                      |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Buy W3PI        | 0.55%          | Purchase transactions             |
| Sell W3PI       | 0.95%          | Sale transactions                 |
| Streaming Fee   | 1.95% annually | Portfolio management              |
| Staking Rewards | 10%            | Performance fee on staking yields |

## üöÄ Quick Start

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup component add rust-src
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --force --locked cargo-contract

# Install Pop CLI for Polkadot development

```

### Build & Deploy

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/w3pi.git
cd w3pi

# Build all contracts
./scripts/build.sh

# Deploy to testnet (Paseo recommended)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Initialize with base tokens
./scripts/setup-index.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/test.sh
```

## üìã Contract System

### üéØ Registry Contract (Core Hub)

**Purpose**: Central coordinator managing the entire W3PI ecosystem

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Token registration and tier classification
- $100 base value tracking and index performance calculation
- Monthly rebalancing coordination using 4-week averages
- Autonomous zombie stake detection and reallocation
- Cross-contract operation orchestration
- Emergency pause and risk management

```rust
// Example: Get current index value
let index_value = registry.get_index_value()?;
// Returns: Current value relative to $100 base (e.g., $117.50 = +17.5%)
```

### üîÆ Oracle Contract

**Purpose**: Decentralized price feeds with TWAP and validation

**Features**:

- Multi-source price aggregation
- Time-weighted average price (TWAP) calculation
- Price deviation detection (max 5% threshold)
- Market cap and volume tracking
- Backup oracle fallback mechanisms

```rust
// Example: Get validated token price
let price = oracle.get_twap_price(token_address, time_window)?;
```

### üí± DEX Contract

**Purpose**: Automated token swaps and liquidity management

**Features**:

- Multi-path swap optimization (direct, DOT-bridged, USDC-bridged)
- Slippage protection
- Liquidity buffer management (5% of portfolio)
- Emergency liquidity provision during mass redemptions

### ü™ô Token Contract (W3PI)

**Purpose**: W3PI token minting, burning, and transfer logic

**Features**:

- Dynamic supply based on market participation
- Order matching system (buyers vs sellers before mint/burn)
- Fee collection and distribution
- Performance tracking per holder

### ü•© Staking Contract

**Purpose**: Automated staking of underlying assets with yield optimization

**Features**:

- Proportional staking based on portfolio weights
- Automatic reward claiming and reinvestment
- Variable unstaking periods per token
- 10% performance fee on all staking rewards

## üßπ Autonomous Zombie Stake Management

### The Problem

When tokens get removed from the index, their staked portions remain locked, creating "zombie stakes" that don't contribute to index performance.

### Autonomous Solution

During monthly rebalancing, the system automatically:

1. **Detects** obsolete tokens (Tier::None + expired 90-day grace period)
2. **Unstakes** any remaining staked balances
3. **Liquidates** to USDC via optimal swap paths
4. **Redistributes** proceeds proportionally to current active tokens
5. **Emits** `ObsoleteStakeReallocated` events for transparency

**Result**: Users stay fully exposed to current index composition without manual intervention.

## üí° Example Workflows

### Basic User Journey

```bash
# 1. User buys W3PI with USDC
pop call --message buy_w3pi --args 1000_000000  # $1,000 USDC
# ‚Üí Receives W3PI tokens, system buys underlying assets

# 2. User stakes W3PI for yield
pop call --message stake_w3pi --args 500_000000  # Stake 500 W3PI
# ‚Üí Underlying tokens automatically staked, user earns rewards

# 3. Monthly rebalancing occurs automatically
# ‚Üí System unstakes obsolete tokens, rebalances portfolio

# 4. User sells W3PI
pop call --message sell_w3pi --args 200_000000  # Sell 200 W3PI
# ‚Üí System liquidates proportional underlying assets, user receives USDC
```

### Index Performance Tracking

```bash
# Get current index performance
pop call --message get_index_value
# Returns: { "base_value": 100, "current_value": 125.50, "performance": "+25.5%" }

# Get detailed portfolio composition
pop call --message get_portfolio_composition
# Returns: Detailed breakdown of current tokens, weights, and values
```

## üß™ Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

```bash
# Unit tests for all contracts
cargo test --workspace

# Integration tests
./scripts/integration-test.sh

# Rebalancing simulation
./scripts/test-rebalancing.sh

# Zombie stake cleanup test
./scripts/test-zombie-cleanup.sh

## üîß Advanced Features

### Monthly Rebalancing Algorithm

```rust
// Hybrid approach combining market cap weights with deviation limits
let four_week_average = calculate_market_cap_average(28_days);
let target_weights = normalize_weights(four_week_average);
let current_weights = get_current_portfolio_weights();

// Limit maximum shift to 20% of portfolio per month
let adjustments = calculate_bounded_adjustments(
    current_weights,
    target_weights,
    max_shift_pct: 20.0
);

execute_rebalancing(adjustments);
```

### Emergency Risk Management

```rust
// Automatic pause triggers
if mass_unstaking_detected(threshold: 25%) {
    trigger_emergency_pause("Mass unstaking detected");
}

if price_deviation_exceeded(threshold: 5%) {
    pause_trading_operations();
    emit_price_deviation_alert();
}
```
